# ‚Äçüíª About Me:
 I am a Software Developer with 4+ years of professional experience in Agile environments, specializing in the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). My passion is to create robust software with seamless user experiences.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in Java, JavaScript, Spring, React, AWS, and REST APIs. With a strong foundation in object-oriented programming (OOP), design patterns, best practices, algorithms, and data structures, I bring a comprehensive skill set to every project.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have excellent communication and teamwork skills. I believe that effective collaboration and open communication are key to successful software development. I actively engage with stakeholders, gather requirements, and ensure clear and concise communication within cross-functional teams, enabling us to deliver high-quality software solutions on time.

Driven by a passion for continuous growth and innovation, I seek new opportunities and collaborations that will challenge me professionally and contribute to my personal development. I would love to connect if you're looking for a dedicated and adaptable Software Developer who thrives in dynamic environments and values effective teamwork. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for exciting job opportunities and potential collaborations.
